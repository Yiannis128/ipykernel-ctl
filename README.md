# ipykernel-ctl

Easily deploy IPyKernel for Python Environments. Automatically deploy and manage IPyKernel instances. IPyKernel allows to run Python environments in Jupyter Lab and Notebook. Deploy a kernel while inside of an environment, to use that environment in Jupyter Lab and Notebook. Note that IPyKernel and Jupyter Lab should be installed on your user Python environment (only for data redundancy reasons).
